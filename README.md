# Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction-Project
ðŸ“– Project DefinitionÂ¶
Overview

This project aims to predict whether a bank's customers will churn (i.e., leave the bank) based on various customer attributes. Customer churn is a critical issue in the banking industry as retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

Objectives:

> Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the dataset for modeling.
> Exploratory Data Analysis: Understand the data distribution and relationships between features.
> Feature Engineering: Create new features that may help improve model performance.
> Model Building: Train and evaluate different machine learning models to predict customer churn.
> Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the models using appropriate metrics and visualization techniques.
> Model Deployment: Save the best-performing model for future use.
> Data Description:

The dataset used in this project is the "Churn_Modelling.csv" file, which contains the following attributes:

* CustomerId: Unique identifier for each customer.
* Surname: Customer's last name.
